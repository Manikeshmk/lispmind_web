# LispMind Web — A Rule-Based AI Assistant

> **Symbolic AI for the Browser** — A complete chatbot implementation powered by ClojureScript, demonstrating rule-based reasoning, pattern matching, and inference systems.

## 🎯 Overview

LispMind Web is an intelligent chatbot assistant that runs entirely in your browser. Built with **ClojureScript** (a Lisp dialect), it showcases modern symbolic AI concepts:

- **Rule-Based Reasoning**: If-then rules for decision making
- **Pattern Matching**: Sophisticated text analysis
- **Memory Management**: Persistent user information
- **Inference Engine**: Symptom-to-diagnosis reasoning
- **Natural Language Processing**: Intent and emotion detection
- **Functional Programming**: Pure functions and immutable state

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Greeting Detection**
The AI recognizes greetings like "hello", "hi", "hey" and responds warmly.

```
User: hello
AI: Hello! Nice to meet you.
```

### 2. **Memory System**
Store and retrieve user information using ClojureScript atoms.

```
User: my name is Arun
AI: I will remember your name Arun. Nice to meet you!

User: what is my name
AI: Your name is Arun.
```

### 3. **Emotion Detection**
Identifies emotions and responds with empathy.

```
User: I am sad
AI: I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things improve soon. Remember that better days are ahead.
```

### 4. **Inference Engine**
Applies symbolic reasoning rules to diagnose based on symptoms.

```
User: I have fever and cough
AI: You may have flu symptoms. Rest and stay hydrated.
```

### 5. **Knowledge Questions**
Answer domain-specific questions about Lisp and AI.

```
User: what is lisp
AI: Lisp is a symbolic programming language used in AI systems...

User: what is AI
AI: Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence by machines...
```

### 6. **Smart Fallback**
Graceful handling of unknown inputs.

```
User: xyzabc
AI: I do not understand. Could you rephrase that? Try saying 'help' for suggestions.
```

### Key ClojureScript Features Used

1. **Atoms for State**: `(atom {})` for persistent memory
2. **Pattern Matching**: `cond` and `str/includes?` for rule matching
3. **Pure Functions**: Immutable data transformations
4. **Higher-Order Functions**: `some`, `reduce`, `swap!`
5. **Regular Expressions**: `re-find`, `re-seq` for text parsing

## 📝 Code Examples

### Adding a New Greeting

```clojure
;; In src/core.cljs, update greeting-patterns:
(def greeting-patterns
  {:hello "Hello! Nice to meet you."
   :hi "Hi there! How can I help you?"
   :howdy "Howdy partner!"  ;; New greeting
  })
```

### Adding a New Symptom Rule

```clojure
;; In src/core.cljs, update symptom-rules:
(def symptom-rules
  {
   #{:fever :cough} {:diagnosis "You may have flu symptoms." :recommendation "Rest and stay hydrated."}
   #{:runny-nose :congestion} {:diagnosis "You may have allergies." :recommendation "Consider antihistamines."}  ;; New rule
  })
```

### Adding Knowledge

```clojure
;; In src/core.cljs, update knowledge-base:
(def knowledge-base
  {:lisp "Lisp is..."
   :python "Python is a versatile programming language..."  ;; New entry
  })
```

## 🎨 UI Customization

The interface uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theming:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #00d4ff;          /* Cyan accent */
    --secondary-color: #6366f1;        /* Indigo accent */
    --background-dark: #0f0f1e;        /* Very dark blue */
    --text-primary: #ffffff;           /* White text */
    /* ... more colors ... */
}
```

Change colors in `public/style.css` to customize the theme.

## 🔍 Browser Console

The chatbot logs initialization messages. Open your browser's developer tools (F12) to see:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `npm install` fails | Update Node.js to v16+ |
| `shadow-cljs` not found | Run `npm install` again |
| No JavaScript generated | Run `npm run build` instead of watch |
| Page shows blank | Check browser console (F12) for errors |
| GitHub Pages not updating | Wait 1-2 minutes and hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) |
